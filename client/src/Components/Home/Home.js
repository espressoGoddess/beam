You&apos;ll be asked to choose a feeling and reflect on it. Add anything about your experience that might help you avoid or recreate the feeling in the future (depending on the feeling). After your reflection, you&apos;ll see an offering of a few activities that might help. <br/><br/>Your entries will be available to you in the Feelings Archive for future reflection. <br/> <br/>We hope this process will help reveal useful patterns over time.</p>
